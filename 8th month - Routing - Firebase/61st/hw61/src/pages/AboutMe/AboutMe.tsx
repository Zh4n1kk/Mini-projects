			<p className="text-mention">Education & Career Objective</p>
			<p className="border-left">
				I am a third-year student at the Almaty University of Power Engineering
				and Telecommunications (AUES), currently pursuing a degree in Radio
				Electronic Technologies. Alongside my academic studies, I am actively
				building a career in frontend development, aiming to secure a Junior
				Frontend Developer position and continuously refine my skills through
				real-world experience.
			</p>
			<p className="text-mention">Technical Background</p>
			<p className="border-left">
				My technical background includes practical experience with HTML5, CSS3
				(Flexbox, Grid), JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, React.js, Next.js, and
				Vite. I have applied these technologies in a variety of self-driven and
				educational projects. I follow clean code principles and emphasize
				modularity, code readability, and maintainability in my development
				process.
			</p>
			<p className="text-mention">Learning Focus & Problem-Solving</p>
			<p className="border-left">
				Currently, I am focused on closing knowledge gaps, reinforcing my
				theoretical understanding, and gaining hands-on experience through
				applied problem-solving. I believe that real development work is the
				most effective way to achieve mastery of the tools and technologies I
				work with.
			</p>
			<p className="text-mention">Development Workflow & Collaboration</p>
			<p className="border-left">
				I consider myself a communicative and collaborative person, open to
				discussion and feedback. My development workflow often begins with a
				raw, unstructured implementation of the required features, followed by
				structured refinement and optimization through iterative improvements.
			</p>
			<p className="text-mention">Soft Skills & Languages</p>
			<p className="border-left">
				In addition to my technical background, I have previous work experience
				in the entertainment sector as a childrenâ€™s animator, which helped me
				develop strong interpersonal and organizational skills. I am fluent in
				Russian, Kazakh, and English, and possess basic reading and
				pronunciation skills in French.
			</p>
			<p className="text-mention">Professional Goals</p>
			<p className="border-left">
				My immediate goal is to obtain my first professional experience in a
				real-world development environment and grow steadily into a confident
				and capable frontend engineer.
